### What did you learn from working with a partner?

Hien:

I learned a different style of working from my partner, and that taking the time to plan out and test a project ultimately saves a lot of time in the end.
Michael:

I learned (or attempted) to verbalize my thoughts in order to stay on the same page as my partner. I also
learned that git issue tracking is very useful, and that no matter how small you might think your project scope
is at the beginning, by the end you'll be jettisoning planned features left and right.

### What was the biggest challenge you had to overcome?

Drawing the family tree.
